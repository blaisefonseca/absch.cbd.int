              <p>The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (Nagoya Protocol) was adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on 29 October 2010. Article 14 of the Protocol establishes the Access and Benefit-Sharing Clearing-House (ABS-CH) as part of Clearing-House under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention. Article 14 also includes an obligation to Parties to make certain types of information available through the ABS-CH. Parties will be expected to provide and update the information required under the Protocol and this will be the primary task of the information-exchange system.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Work has been carried out on the development of the Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House since the adoption of the Protocol. Prior to the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol (ICNP), an expert meeting on the modalities of operation of the ABS Clearing-House was held in April 2011 to examine practical considerations related to the establishment of the ABS Clearing-House with a view to provide input to the first meeting of the ICNP and to assist countries with the early ratification and implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. <br><br>To assist the experts in their deliberations, a study (document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/emabschm-01/official/emabschm-01-02-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ABS/EM-CH/1/2</a>) was commissioned on the issue by the Executive Secretary. The report of the expert meeting (document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/emabschm-01/official/emabschm-01-04-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ABS/EM-CH/1/4</a>) was put forward to the first meeting of the ICNP for its consideration. <br><br>At the first meeting of the ICNP, Parties recommended that the first phase of the ABS Clearing-House be a pilot phase and requested the Executive Secretary to implement the pilot phase in accordance with the guidance set out in the annex of recommendation 1/1. <br><br>At its second meeting, the ICNP considered the report on the progress made in the implementation of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House, the suggested mechanisms and applications to be developed during the pilot phase (document <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/icnp-02/official/icnp-02-08-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ICNP/2/8</a>) and the draft modalities of operation of the ABS Clearing-House (document <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/icnp-02/official/icnp-02-09-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ICNP/2/9</a>). <br><br>In its <a href="https://www.cbd.int/recommendation/icnp/default.shtml?id=13088">recommendation 2/4</a>, the ICNP took note of the suggestions put forward by the Executive Secretary with respect to the development of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House and requested the Executive Secretary to report on further progress made in its implementation at the eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP-11). Furthermore, the ICNP recommended that COP-11 decide on a process forward for further advancing the development of the ABS Clearing-House. <br><br>The eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties, in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/COP-11/cop-11-dec-01-en.pdf">decision XI/1</a>, endorsed the indicative work plan and timeline for activities to take place until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, as contained in document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/COP-11/cop-11-dec-01-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/COP/11/11</a> and decided to establish an informal advisory committee (IAC) to assist the Executive Secretary with the implementation of the pilot phase and to provide technical guidance with respect to the resolution of technical issues. The IAC will hold one meeting, as well as informal online discussions, and report to the third meeting of the ICNP. <br><br>The decision also included a request to the Executive Secretary to report on progress made in the implementation of the pilot phase, including on the registration of information related to permits or their equivalents and on technical issues concerning the establishment of the internationally recognized certificate of compliance, and to refine the draft modalities of operation, taking into account the experience acquired during the pilot phase, for their consideration by the third meeting of the ICNP.

                Article 10 of the Nagoya Protocol requires the Parties to consider the need for and modalities of a global multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism to address the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the utilization of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources that occur in transboundary situations or for which it is not possible to grant or obtain prior informed consent. <br><br>The article also states that benefits shared by users of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources through this mechanism shall be used to support the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components globally.<br> <br>In decision XI/1, the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity mandated a number of activities concerning Article 10 of the Nagoya Protocol to take place during the current inter-sessional period. This portal on Article 10 is intended to provide up-to-date information on these activities.<br> <br>
                The online discussion groups on Article 10 are now complete. All the messages posted during the discussions will remain available through the <a href="https://bch.cbd.int/abs/art10_groups/">'Discussion groups'</a> page. <br><br>The next step in the process mandated by decision XI/1 is the expert group meeting. Participants in the expert group on Article 10 will be selected from among those who took part in the online discussion groups and will be notified in due course. <br><br>The expert group meeting will be held from 17 to 19 September 2013 in Montreal.

            <p>Article 14 of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization establishes an Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS Clearing-House) as part of the clearing-house mechanism under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 
            </p>
            <p>In accordance with recommendation 1/1 of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol (the Intergovernmental Committee), the Executive Secretary is currently implementing the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House based on the guidance set out in the annex to recommendation 1/1 and in recommendation 2/4. In addition, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention endorsed an indicative work plan and timeline for activities to take place until the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP), as contained in document UNEP/CBD/COP/11/11 (decision XI/1 C, paragraph 2).
            </p>
            <p>
            In paragraph 1 of decision XI/1 C, the Conference of the Parties established an informal advisory committee (IAC) to assist the Executive Secretary with the implementation of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House and to provide technical guidance with respect to the resolution of technical issues arising from the ongoing development of the pilot phase until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol. The decision provided that the IAC should be regionally balanced and composed of fifteen experts selected on the basis of nominations provided by Parties.
            </p>
            <p>
            In paragraph 3 of this decision, the Conference of the Parties decided that the IAC would hold one meeting, subject to the availability of financial resources, and informal online discussions, as needed, and report on the outcomes of its work to the third meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee. Thanks to the generous financial support of the European Union, the meeting of the IAC was held in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=ABS-IAC-CH-01">Montreal, from 2 to 4 October 2013</a>.
