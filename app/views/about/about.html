                <h1>About the ABS Clearing-House</h1>
                <h3 id="about-intro">Introduction</h3>
                <p> The Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABSCH) is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, as part of clearing-house mechanism under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention. The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain, including through the internationally recognized certificate of compliance. By hosting relevant information regarding ABS, the Clearing-House offers opportunities for connecting users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</p>
                
                <h3  id="about-bg">Background</h3>
                <p> The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (ABS) was negotiated in order to provide greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and   associated traditional knowledge by: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Establishing more predictable conditions for access to those resources; and</li>
                <li>Helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting Party providing the genetic resources.</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Researchers and businesses need to secure legal clarity, certainty and transparency when accessing genetic resources and/or associated traditional knowledge. Without such legal certainty, potential users of genetic resources and/or associate traditional knowledge could be less eager to invest in bioprospecting and researching activities, as their activities may lead to controversy and allegations of misappropriation or misuse of these resources or knowledge. </p>
                    <p>Providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, on the other hand, want to ensure that benefits arising from the utilization of their resources are shared in a fair and equitable manner once the resource or knowledge leaves the country.</p>
                    <div class="well">
                        <h5> What Users want:</h5>
                        <li>Access to genetic resources (GR)  and associated traditional knowledge (TK)</li>
                        <li>A clear understanding about how to access GR and TK</li>
                        <li>Legal certainty for utilizing the GR and TK when due process has been followed</li>
        
                        <h5>What Providers want:</h5>
                        <li>Control over access to their own GR and TK</li>
                        <li>Ensure that users comply with all conditions set in MAT</li>
                        <li>Assurance that the entitled  benefits arising from utilization are received in accordance with MAT</li>

                        <h5>What everybody wants:</h5>
                        <li>Fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
                        <li>Sustainable use of biodiversity</li>
                        <li>Conservation of biodiversity</li>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The Nagoya Protocol provisions on access, benefit-sharing and compliance, provides a framework that aims to address the concerns of both users and providers. </p>

                    <p>However, in order to translate the Nagoya Protocol into practice, Parties need to create the necessary conditions and take the measures required by the Protocol to ensure that a national framework is in place to implement ABS at the national level and enable the development of ABS agreements for the benefit of all involved in the process.</p>


                    <p>It is in this context and with this aim that Parties to the CBD included [Article 14], in the Nagoya Protocol, which establishes an Access and Benefit Sharing Clearing House (ABS Clearing-House). </p>

                    <p>The Nagoya Protocol establishes the ABS Clearing-House, as part of the clearing-house mechanism of the Convention, as a means for sharing information related to access and benefit-sharing, and in particular its goal is to provide access to information made available by each Party relevant to the implementation of the Protocol. </p>

                    <p>The ABS Clearing-House allows countries to share information on procedures for accessing genetic resources and monitor the utilization of the resources along the value chain. The ABS Clearing-House plays a key role in enhancing the legal certainty and transparency that both providers and users of genetic resources, as well as associated traditional knowledge, are looking for.</p>
                    
                    <div class="well">
                        <h5>Making the ABC’s of ABS a reality</h5>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>ccess – Enhancing legal certainty, transparency and clarity on how to access genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>B</strong>enefit-sharing – Contributing to increase opportunities for sharing benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>C</strong>ompliance – Assisting to ensure compliance with ABS measures and transparency in monitoring the utilization of genetic resources through the value chain.</li>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>A fully functional ABS Clearing-House also represents a major step in achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 16, which provides that by 2015, the Nagoya Protocol is in force and operational, consistent with national legislations.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="about-what">What is the ABS Clearing-House</h3>
                    <p>Article 14, of the Nagoya Protocol, establishes the ABS Clearing-House, as part of the clearing-house mechanism of the Convention, as a means for sharing information related to access and benefit-sharing, and in particular its goal is to provide access to information made available by each Party relevant to the implementation of the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>n practical terms, the sharing of information is done through an online platform designed to enable, primarily Parties, but also non-Parties  indigenous and local communities (ILCs), international and non-governmental organizations, research institutions and businesses to make information available  and access information related to access and benefit-sharing.</p>
                    <p>To ensure that the ABS-CH fulfills its role in adding clarity and transparency in access and benefit-sharing, Parties to the CBD agreed in Article 14 of the Protocol, to make mandatory for Parties to share certain types of information through the ABS Clearing-House, namely:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Legislative, administrative and policy measures on access and benefit-sharing;</li>
                        <li>Information on the national focal point and competent national authority or authorities (CNA); and</li>
                        <li>Permits or their equivalent issued at the time of access as evidence of the decision to grant prior informed consent (PIC) and of the establishment of mutually agreed terms (MAT).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In addition to this essential information, the Protocol also identifies other types of information to make available through the ABS-CH.</p>
                    <div class="well">
                        <h5>Information-sharing obligations under the Protocol</h5>
                        <p>Each Party to the Nagoya Protocol is required to make available the following types of information to the ABS Clearing-House in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2:  </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

                        </ul>
                        <p>Article 14, paragraph 2, also requires Parties to make available through the ABS Clearing-House any information required by this Protocol. This would include: </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                            <li>Measures to inform potential users of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources about their obligations for access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge (Article 12, paragraph 2);</li>
                            <li>Information provided to designated checkpoints that collect or receive, as appropriate, relevant information related to prior informed consent, to the source of the genetic resource, to the establishment of mutually agreed terms, and/or to the utilization of genetic resources, including from internationally recognized certificates of compliance (IRCC), where they are available (Article 17, paragraph 1 (a) (iii)); and</li>
                            <li> Information on capacity-building and development initiatives at national, regional and international levels that should be shared through the ABS Clearing-House with a view to promoting synergy and coordination on capacity-building and development for access and benefit-sharing (Article 22, paragraph 6).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ABS Clearing-House will also need to provide access to other types of information that Parties may provide, or officially endorse, relevant to the implementation of the Protocol. Additional information specified in the Protocol (Article 14, paragraph 3) includes: </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                            <li>Relevant competent authorities of indigenous and local communities (ILCs), and information as so decided; </li>

                    <h1>Why is the ABS Clearing-House important</h1>

                    <p id="about-why1"><strong>1. The ABS Clearing-House facilitates the connection between users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. </strong></p>
                    <p>The ABS Clearing-House allows providers to share information on contacts and requirements for accessing genetic resources and traditional knowledge through this platform. Users can then easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location. </p>
                    <p>By providing reliable information, the ABS Clearing-House facilitates the connection between users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore creates opportunities for ABS agreements.</p>
                    <p>The ABS Clearing-House increases opportunities for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits coming from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="about-why2"><strong>2. The ABS Clearing-House helps users to comply with national ABS measures and requirements.</strong></p>
                    <p>By sharing reliable and complete information regarding national measures and requirements on ABS through the ABS Clearing-House, countries can help users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge understand and follow ABS rules and facilitate users’ compliance with national legislation.</p>
                     <br>
                    <p id="about-why3"><strong>3. The ABS Clearing-House provides tools to help countries monitor the utilization of genetic resources.</strong></p>
                    <p>Through a centralized and standardized system, the ABS Clearing-House helps providers monitor how their genetic resources are being used throughout the value chain. When a provider country grants access to a genetic resource and publishes information on the permit or an equivalent, the ABS Clearing-House automatically generates an internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC). </p>
                    <p>The IRCC helps users of genetic resources to provide the required information to the checkpoints. The ABS Clearing-House also provides a tool called the checkpoint communiqué that can be used to gather the information collected or received by the checkpoint, including from the IRCC,  and send it to all those involved in the process, namely the Party providing prior informed consent.</p>
                     <br>
                    <p id="about-why4"><strong>4. The ABS Clearing-House offers reliable and up-to-date information. </strong></p>
