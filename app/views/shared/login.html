       <h3>How do I register for a CBD account?</h3>
       <p>Any person can have a CBD account which will give you access to register information in all CBD clearing-houses including the Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH), the ABS Clearing-House (ABS-CH) and the clearing-house mechanism (CHM) under the Convention. You can register for a CBD account at <a href="http://accounts.cbd.int/signin" class="bold">accounts.cbd.int/signin</a></p>
        <p>Make sure you enter all the information required as instructed on the form. Youâ€™ll automatically receive an e-mail with a link you have to click to confirm your account.</p>
       <h3>Forgot your password?</h3>
        <p>You can click here accounts.cbd.int/password/reset. You will be asked for your email address and, if you are a registered user, an email will be sent immediately to your registered email account with instructions to reset your password.</p>
        <h3>Problems signing in?</h3>
        <p>At the moment, the ABS-CH works best with the most recent versions of internet browsers (Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer 9+). 
        Please ensure your internet browser meets the minimum requirement recommended to use the ABS-CH.</p>
