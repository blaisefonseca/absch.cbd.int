            <p>Middle-earth is widely known to be rich in magical genetic resources. Middle-earth’s population is generally made up of several independent elves local communities. Magic genetic resources are important economically as well as culturally and traditionally for the Middle-earth and the local people. Many magic genetic resources and their wild relatives are found in the wild areas and elves territories. The elves local communities are the main caretakers of Middle-earth’s magic genetic resources and the sole holders of the associated magic knowledge. These genetic resource and the ecosystems where the grow and flourish also provide many wide ranging national and global socio-economic and environmental benefits,  from contributing to the fight against climate change to supporting the basic magic needs of the most marginalized and vulnerable of Middle-earth’s people like the Hobbits.</p>
