            <p>The User is a young wizard named Harry User. Harry is from Wizardâ€™s Kingdom. </p>
            <p>Harry needs to obtain supplies for his research on improving a new magic potion that has the power of making plants grow just
            by pouring three drops of the potion. Harry User thinks that this potion has a lot of potential for improving biodiversity in
             degraded areas. Harry has all the ingredients he needs for his magic potion except one, Sopophorous Beans. He is interested
             in doing more research into the conditions needed to grow the bean in the laboratory.</p>

             <p class="goal color-red">
                 The User's goal is to perfect his potion, do some valuable and interesting research and soon start your own business selling a new
                 magic potion that would contribute to increase biodiversity.
